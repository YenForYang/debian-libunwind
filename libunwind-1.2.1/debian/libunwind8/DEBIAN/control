Description: library to determine the call-chain of a program - runtime
 The primary goal of this project is to define a portable and efficient C
 programming interface (API) to determine the call-chain of a program.
 The API additionally provides the means to manipulate the preserved
 (callee-saved) state of each call-frame and to resume execution at any
 point in the call-chain (non-local goto). The API supports both local
 (same-process) and remote (across-process) operation. As such, the API
 is useful in a number of applications.
